  - multi-instrument runs, mzml definition file can be used to spec instrument
  - Enable diff TMT/itraq mixing
  - Multiple DBs possible to pass e.g. `--tdb /path/to/*.fa`
  - `--hirief` flag contains the peptide pI file previously specified in `--pipep`
- msstitch updated to v3.2 (no longer need Biomart map)
- General package update for openMS, R packages
- Luciphor based PTM reporting on PSM/peptide tables, for phospho, e.g not working yet is acetyl/TMT

- Upgrade openMS to 2.5
- Upgrade MSGF+ to 2020.04.14

- Low impact fixes for runs with bad MS / few PSMs.

- Do not crash when PSM data for some but not all sets is not good enough
- miscleav/set/fr/plate not by python script but in pipeline or by msstitch

- Got a Zenodo DOI

## Version 1.1
- More QC for DEqMS, added  PCA and Volcano plots
- Added support for non-linear pI strips for HiRIEF (e.g. 3.4-4.8), defined as multiple fraction intervals
- Fixed bug that did not filter out features with <1 median PSM count before running DEqMS (rare case)

## Version 1.0.2
First proper versioned release on glormph/nf-core-dda-quant-proteomics
